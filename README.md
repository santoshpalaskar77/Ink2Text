# Ink2Text: Tool to convert Images/PDF to LaTeX document 

![ink2text](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c428e743-012b-45c6-82cf-fd8ff4d3d00d) 
## Installation Requirements
- It is recommended to create a conda environment with the following:
  - `Python 3.10.15`
  - The necessary Python packages can be installed from the `requirements.txt` file using,
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
## Instructions for Running the Code
- Must clone this repo to the desired machine
- Download the checkpoint from: [Checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z7MMYoh_bCl0YjJm_aPhvXf68aeOL-E0?usp=drive_link)
   - checkpoint_for_text is for formula and text head: image contains formula and images. It can also be used for formula recognition, or we can use TexTeller, as it is mainly trained for formula recognition
   - checkpoint_text is for text recognition
- Put checkpoints in the directory ``` src/checkpoints ```
## Running code using interface 
- Your directory should be **src**   ``` cd src ```
- Run the sh file in the terminal: ``` ./start_web.sh ```
- You can open the link in the browser

- You can upload the desired PNG/JGP/PDF file, which will produce the corresponding latex tex file and pdf file. It also corrects grammatical mistakes
## Running code using terminal 
- inference.py can be used for inference
- Use the finetuned texteller model by: ``` latex_rec_model = TexTeller.from_pretrained('checkpoints/checkpoint_for_text')``` in the inference.py file
- Run the code in the terminal: ``` python inference.py -img "/path/to/image.{jpg,png}" ```
- To apply grammatical correction, use the command ``` python inference.py -img "/path/to/image.{jpg,png}" -grammar ```

## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Training

### Dataset

We provide an example dataset in the `src/models/ocr_model/train/dataset/` directory, you can place your own images in the `images/` directory and annotate each image with its corresponding formula in `formulas.jsonl`.

After preparing your dataset, you need to **change the `DIR_URL` variable to your own dataset's path** in `**/train/dataset/loader.py`

### Training the Model

1. Modify `num_processes` in `src/train_config.yaml` to match the number of GPUs available for training (default is 1).
2. In the `src/` directory, run the following command:

   ```bash
   accelerate launch --config_file ./train_config.yaml -m models.ocr_model.train.train
   ```

You can set your own tokenizer and checkpoint paths in `src/models/ocr_model/train/train.py` (refer to `train.py` for more information). If you are using the same architecture and vocabulary as Ink2Text, you can also fine-tune Ink2Text's default weights with your own dataset.
